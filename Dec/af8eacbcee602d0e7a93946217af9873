Dolphins coach Lance Klusener says the availability of batsman Kevin Pietersen does not guarantee his side a place in the final of the T20 Challenge.The Dolphins announced that the former England batsman is available for selection ahead of their crunching encounter with the Cape Cobras in the semi-finals on Wednesday. With Pietersen back we have some quality individuals, we just need to understand that just because he s back doesn t guarantee everything. That s important, Klusener said.The Durban based outfit have had an impressive run in the round robin stages, registering five victories and finishing on the second spot in the log standings.&#8220;The way we went about winning was good, The way we bowled was again excellent so I m pretty happy,Holding fingers and thumbs, Klusener said.While Klusener and his charges received a major boost, the Cape Town based outfit were dealt a major blow, with batsman Justin Kemp ruled out of the clash.Ezekiel Kekana
