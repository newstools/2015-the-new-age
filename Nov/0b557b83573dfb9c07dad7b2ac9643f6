Anudita Mishra, 34, a homemaker says, &#8220;I love to be showered with compliments as I think most women do. It gives my ego a boost when my hubby says, &#8216;This dress suits you&#8217;, or something like &#8211; &#8216;You look prettier than any of those ladies I know&#8217; or saying, &#8216;I wonder how you look so sexy even in your 30s!&#8217; It just makes me feel good about myself.&#8217;Hear say: Dr. Sushma Dayal, a clinical psychologist says, &#8220;Each of us like to receive compliments as it improves our self-image.

Say this only when you mean it so that she never questions your loyalty.Abhay Bajaj, 26, a marketing professional says, &#8220;When I told my girlfriend that she is the first woman in my life, she was utterly surprised. It&#8217;s funny, but I believe most women have a myth that guys are rarely committed to a single woman. Once she was convinced, she was able to free herself from all insecurities and was head over heels for me.&#8221;Hear say: Archana Nanda, a psychologist opines, &#8220;Telling a woman that she is the first person you have been so close to is sure to elevate her self-esteem and assure her of your faithfulness.

Saying this is bound to put her on cloud nine &#8211; particularly when her man thinks she has all that it takes to be a nurturing mother. In a way, you&#8217;ll also be assuring her of your commitment and that you would like to bring up your kids with her. Ritu Jaiswal, 27, who got married a year ago, confesses, &#8220;It was my husband who made me comfortable with the idea of parenthood.

We work in the same office. Although I like him very much, I was a bit reluctant to commit to him prematurely.

By doing this, you are not just asserting that her opinion is important to you, but also that you respect her views.
