African beauty over the course of the 20th century is in the spotlight thanks to the latest instalment of the cult &#8220;100 Years of Beauty&#8221; series, focusing on Ethiopia.Starring model Feven G, the film takes us on a whistle-stop tour of looks from the 1910s to the present date.The first look sees Feven sporting a row of neat cornrows braided back into a dramatic ponytail for a bold and playful effect, which is confirmed by the addition of a choker necklace and a chunky ear cuff, hidden under a colorful headscarf.The Twenties herald a much more pared-down look, comprising a chic updo, thinly-plucked eyebrows and no jewelry. It&#8217;s all change for the Thirties, which require a voluminous afro and a natural makeup-free style.A slightly messy chignon is the look du jour of the Forties before full-on glamour takes over for the Fifties, portrayed through shimmering red lipstick, elaborate stud earrings and slicked-back hair neatly parted and tucked into a bright yellow scarf.A bobbed hairstlye and candy pink lipstick capture the sweet aesthetic of the Sixties, while a berry lip and carefully-arranged hair flicks create a more dramatic vibe for the Seventies.Acidic pink eyeshadow, red lips and plenty of bling offer up a punkier Eighties style while a top knot complete with a double helping of gold scrunchies perfectly captures the look of the Nineties.The new century brings with it a smoky eye, slick ponytail and hoop earrings, before the current decade takes over, heralding a pretty and free look in the form of bright lipstick and long, loose flowing hair.-Relaxnews
